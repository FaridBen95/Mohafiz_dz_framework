App.TEST_MODE should be used in just test mode otherwise don't forget to change it to flase in production

App.syncUsingBackgroundServices use this always when trying to sync and don't forget to specify which methode you want to use before start coding
keep in mind background services won't work properly in some devices so it's better to prevent using it
